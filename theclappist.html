      I started coding when I was either in 3rd or 4th grade, and since I loved coding so much I pretty much started doing it all the time, but then, I took a big break, so im a little rusty at this. I learned HTML (HyperText Markup Language) from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3schools</a>.
      <br>
      Te Developer (my business,) was named after everything I made Te, starting with Te Quiz, then to Te Site, then to Te Group... You won't find Te SIte because it's not finished yet...
